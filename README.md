# Stack-Slide-Nav

This is a POC (Proof of Concept) of a 3D like stacked cards.
The most valuable is on the front and the least valuable at the very end.

## What I Used

- [Create-React-App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) to setup react
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/) for styling
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for Bootstrap Components
- [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) for icons
- [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com) for icons

## Design

I used Bootstrap with SCSS and changed the color theme.
For this project I select vintage colors.

## Development

1. `npm install` to install deps
